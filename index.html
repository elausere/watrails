        <p>The Enchantments is the epitome of high alpine exploration in Washington. The grueling 18-mile trail can be done in multiple days by obtaining a much sought-after permit. For a real challenge, the entire trail can also be done in one long day of hiking.The sweat equity is well worth the views, though. The trail passes by several craggy peaks and interlinking alpine lakes. A good trail for seasoned hikers seeking more.</p>

        <p>Next to Stuart Lake, this has to be one of the most glorious day trips in the area. This hike is challenging in that it is mostly up, and up, and up. However, the views at the lake are well worth the effort. Many great spots for swimming and snoozing. The trail is primarily used for hiking, camping, and backpacking and is best used from May until October. Also, theres a good chance you'll see several adorable chipmunks</p>

        <p>An easy 2 mile roundtrip hike that leads to beautiful Franklin Falls and is easy for even young hikers to travel. The trail goes through the forest and along a gorge as you trek to the falls. There are a few places in the gorge which has a few really small waterfalls in it, but non of these falls compare to that of Franklin Falls. Franklin Falls leads into a river that is shallow enough to walk across. </p>
